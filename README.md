# gdx-backend-jtransc
GDX backend for JTransc: targeting every platform lime supports but flash (for the moment) (html5, windows, linux, mac, android, ios, tizen...)

This backend for GDX uses:
* [JTransc](https://github.com/jtransc/jtransc/) for converting JVM bytecode into Haxe
* [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) as intermediate language
* [Lime](httphttps://github.com/openfl/lime) as cross-platform multimedia Haxe library
